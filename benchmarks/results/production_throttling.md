# Object-Store Throttling & Fault Resilience Benchmark (§7.4)

- **Engine**: BenoStreamDB (Apache Iceberg transactional object store)
- **Failure Model**: Injected object-store latency (10–25ms across all APIs including `list()`) and transient HTTP 503 SlowDown errors
- **Invariants Enforced**: Deep row content verification (100% exact primary key preservation), bounded tail latency deltas, zero data corruption

| Scenario | Injected Throttling | Write p50 | Write p99 | Δ Write p99 | Read p50 | Read p99 | Δ Read p99 | Harness 503 Retries | Engine OCC Retries | Row Content Integrity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **T1 (Quiescent Baseline)** | None (Quiescent) | **6.09 ms** | 7.81 ms | **+0 ms** | **15.83 ms** | 23.53 ms | **+0 ms** | 0 | 0 | ✅ 100% Match | ✅ PASS |
| **T2 (Moderate Throttling 10ms)** | 10ms delay | **85.27 ms** | 87.49 ms | **+79.68 ms** | **15.88 ms** | 633.26 ms | **+609.73 ms** | 0 | 0 | ✅ 100% Match | ✅ PASS |
| **T3 (Severe Throttling 25ms)** | 25ms delay | **190.79 ms** | 192.58 ms | **+184.77 ms** | **11.94 ms** | 1142.30 ms | **+1118.77 ms** | 0 | 0 | ✅ 100% Match | ✅ PASS |
| **T4 (Transient 503 Rejections 20%)** | 20% 503 SlowDown | **6.02 ms** | 23.47 ms | **+15.66 ms** | **16.39 ms** | 22.30 ms | **-1.23 ms** | 12 | 0 | ✅ 100% Match | ✅ PASS |
| **T5 (Chaos: 15ms Delay + 10% 503)** | 15ms delay + 10% 503s | **120.70 ms** | 185.49 ms | **+177.68 ms** | **12.53 ms** | 713.31 ms | **+689.78 ms** | 4 | 0 | ✅ 100% Match | ✅ PASS |

### Resilience Invariants & Methodology Notes
1. **Row Content Verification**: Unlike superficial row-count checks, every run extracts the full primary key space (`read_all_ids`) and validates 100% set equivalence ($0..N-1$) with zero missing keys and zero duplicates.
2. **Throttled Storage Surface**: All operations (`put`, `put_opts`, `get_opts`, `get_range`, `head`, and `list`) are subjected to consistent injected latency to model real-world high-latency S3/GCS object stores.
3. **Tail Latency Transparency**: Latencies are reported in absolute milliseconds (p50 and p99) along with absolute deltas ($\Delta$ Write p99 / $\Delta$ Read p99) rather than misleading ratio multipliers.
4. **Retries Classification**: Engine-level OCC retries occur during multi-writer manifest conflicts (reported as 0 here because single writer was active), while storage-level transient HTTP 503 SlowDown rejections are retried at the commit boundary with backoff.
